Project2
-
This is a project that I did for my Operating systems class. Its basically a implementation of UNIX/Linux shell program.
It implements some basic guish commands like:
progname [args] : "ls", "ls -l", "ls -l -a"         
Runs the program progname with the given, possibly optional, arguments.

exit
The exit internal command causes the shell to exit.

hist
The hist history internal shell command will display the (up to) 10 most recent commands entered from the user. The commands will always be numbered from 1 to 10. 
All commands (internal or external, successful or unsuccessful, except r and exit) are added to the history list.

r n
The r n internal shell command will execute a command from the history list. The internal shell command "r n" where 'n' is the history number of that command in the history list

MSUBears
-
The program prints the numbers from 1 to 100. 
However, for multiples of three print “MSU” instead of the number and for multiples of five print “Bears”. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “MSUBears”.

File operation 
-
The program reads the first line of a text file and outputs whether that line contains the word “bear.”

Fibonacci sequence 
-
The program that computes the nth Fibonacci number.
The Fibonnaci function is defined below. As examples, F(2) equals 2, F(3) equals 3, F(4) equals 5, F(5) equals 8, and so on.
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2); F(1) = 1; F(0) = 1.
